# Steps Counter App - Network Connectivity Issues & Solutions

## Current Issue
The app is failing to build due to Maven repository connectivity issues. This is commonly caused by:
- Network firewall restrictions
- DNS resolution issues
- Corporate proxy settings
- Regional access limitations

## Immediate Solutions

### Option 1: Use Alternative Repository Mirrors
I've already updated your `android/build.gradle.kts` to use Aliyun mirrors (Chinese CDN) which often work better:

```kotlin
allprojects {
    repositories {
        // Use CDN mirrors for better connectivity
        maven { url = uri("https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/google") }
        maven { url = uri("https://maven.aliyun.com/repository/central") }
        
        // Original repositories as fallback
        google()
        mavenCentral()
        
        // Additional fallback repositories
        maven { url = uri("https://jitpack.io") }
        maven { url = uri("https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/") }
    }
}
```

### Option 2: Use VPN or Different Network
If you have access to a VPN or different network connection, try building from there.

### Option 3: Offline Build (if dependencies are cached)
If you've built similar Flutter projects before, try:
```powershell
flutter build apk --debug --offline
```

### Option 4: Use Different Repositories
Create an `android/init.gradle` file (already created) with mirror repositories.

## Alternative Development Approach

### Test with Web Target
Since web doesn't require Android Gradle build:
```powershell
flutter run -d chrome
```

### Test with Windows Target
If you have Windows support enabled:
```powershell
flutter run -d windows
```

## Simplified App Version
I've created simplified versions of the app files:
- `lib/main_simple.dart` - Basic Flutter app without external dependencies
- `pubspec_simple.yaml` - Minimal dependencies

To test the simplified version:
1. Backup current files: `cp pubspec.yaml pubspec_full.yaml`
2. Use simple version: `cp pubspec_simple.yaml pubspec.yaml`
3. Use simple main: `cp lib/main_simple.dart lib/main.dart`
4. Run: `flutter pub get && flutter run`

## Network Troubleshooting Commands

### Test DNS Resolution
```powershell
nslookup repo.maven.apache.org
nslookup dl.google.com
```

### Test Direct Connection
```powershell
curl -I https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/
curl -I https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/
```

### Check Proxy Settings
```powershell
netsh winhttp show proxy
```

## Next Steps
1. Try building with the updated repository configuration
2. If that fails, test with simplified app version
3. If network issues persist, try different network or VPN
4. Consider using Flutter web for initial development and testing

## Build Commands to Try
```powershell
# Clean everything
flutter clean
rm -rf android/.gradle
rm -rf %USERPROFILE%\.gradle

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Try different build targets
flutter build web                    # Web doesn't need Gradle
flutter build windows               # If Windows target is available
flutter build apk --debug          # Android with new repos
flutter build apk --debug --offline # If dependencies are cached
```
